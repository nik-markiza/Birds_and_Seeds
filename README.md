# Birds & Seeds â€” Marketplace UI/UX Demo (React Native + Expo)

A demo project showcasing an alternative UI navigation flow and filtering logic for a mobile marketplace app. All content and assets are fictional and used solely for demonstration purposes.

## Purpose

This demo explores:

- A redesigned navigation flow
- Enhanced filtering UX (by body style, year, transmission, etc.)
- Practical use of Expo Router and widely used dependencies
- Improved layout structure and responsiveness

This prototype is part of a design and architecture study.
It was built with a focus on usability, simplicity, and scalable logic.

# Welcome to your Expo app ðŸ‘‹

This is an [Expo](https://expo.dev) project created with [`create-expo-app`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-expo-app).

## Get started

1. Install dependencies

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Start the app

   ```bash
   npx expo start
   ```

In the output, you'll find options to open the app in a

- [development build](https://docs.expo.dev/develop/development-builds/introduction/)
- [Android emulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/android-studio-emulator/)
- [iOS simulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/ios-simulator/)
- [Expo Go](https://expo.dev/go), a limited sandbox for trying out app development with Expo

You can start developing by editing the files inside the **app** directory. This project uses [file-based routing](https://docs.expo.dev/router/introduction).

## Get a fresh project

When you're ready, run:

```bash
npm run reset-project
```

This command will move the starter code to the **app-example** directory and create a blank **app** directory where you can start developing.
